quantum
=======

This is a fork of Mario Zechner's [quantum-game](https://code.google.com/p/quantum-game/) with some minor bugfixes and sweet control enhancements.

Quantum is a realtime strategy in the spirit of Galcon and Eufloria. You are in control of creatures that orbit planets. You can colonize new planets by moving creatures to them. To create new Creatures you have to build trees on the planets. The new born creatures will then inherit certain properties from their home planet. The goal of the game is it to eliminate all enemy creatures and overtake all their planets.
